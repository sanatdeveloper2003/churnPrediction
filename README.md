# 📊 Churn Prediction Project

A machine learning project for predicting customer churn using supervised learning models. Built as part of a university assignment, this project focuses on evaluating and comparing multiple classification algorithms to understand customer behavior and retention.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project tackles the problem of customer churn prediction using a structured dataset provided by the professor. The goal is to train and evaluate various classification models, optimize their performance through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, and interpret their predictions using LIME.
